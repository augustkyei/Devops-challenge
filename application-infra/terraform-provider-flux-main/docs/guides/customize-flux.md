  Customizing Flux past the exposed parameters.

# Customize Flux

The Flux datasources expose a set of parameters that can configure the controller deployment. These parameters include all of those
exposed by the `flux bootstrap` CLI command. There may be situations where these parameters are not enough and additional configuration
has to be done. This could be changing the resource requests or limits for a controller, adding annotations or labels, or modifying container settings.

When deploying Flux with the CLI the recommended solution is to [modify the Kustomization file](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/#customize-flux-manifests).
When using terraform to bootstrap flux, the `flux_sync` data source provides a `patch_names` argument and corresponding `patch_file_paths` output value that allow users to provide patches to the `kustomize.yaml` in the same manner.

This guide assumes that you have setup Flux with Terraform already. Follow the [GitHub guide](./github) for a quick example to get a Kubernetes cluster with Flux installed in it.

The following patch file, `psp-patch.yaml`,  will set PSP rules for all of the Flux deployments.

```terraform
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: all-flux-components
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # Required by Kubernetes node autoscaler
        cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict: "true"
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 10000
        fsGroup: 1337
      containers:
        - name: manager
          securityContext:
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            runAsNonRoot: true
            capabilities:
              drop:
                - ALL
```

The patch file can then be read into terraform using the `file` function (alternatively it could be declared directly in terraform using heredoc syntax)
and used as the `content` of a `github_repository_file`. The `kustomize.yaml` content will be generated by the `flux_sync` data source to include patch
files, using a `patchesStrategicMerge`.

Using the `patch_file_paths` output value of `sync_flux`, we can commit the content of each patch to its own file in git. This allows us to implement
small patches that do one thing, in line with the recommendation from the [kustomize docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#customizing).


In the example configuration below, we load `psp-patch.yaml` from the local filesystem, as well as provide a second patch inline as a heredoc to annotate a service account.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.13"

  required_providers {
    google = {
      version = ">= 4.0.0"
    }
    github = {
      source = "integrations/github"
      version = "4.5.2"
    }
    flux = {
      source  = "fluxcd/flux"
      version = ">= 0.0.13"
    }
  }
}

data "google_service_account" "flux_sops" {
  account_id = "flux-sops"
}

locals {
  # 'Small patches that do one thing are recommended'
  #   - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#customizing
  patches = {
    psp  = file("./psp-patch.yaml")
    sops = <<EOT
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: kustomize-controller
  namespace: flux-system
  annotations:
    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: ${data.google_service_account.flux_sops.email}
EOT
  }
}

data "flux_sync" "main" {
  target_path = var.target_path
  url         = var.clone_url
  patch_names = keys(local.patches)
}

# Create kustomize.yaml
resource "github_repository_file" "kustomize" {
  repository          = local.repository_name
  file                = data.flux_sync.flux.kustomize_path
  content             = data.flux_sync.flux.kustomize_content
  branch              = data.github_branch.main.branch
  overwrite_on_create = true
}

resource "github_repository_file" "patches" {
  #  `patch_file_paths` is a map keyed by the keys of `flux_sync.main`
  #  whose values are the paths where the patch files should be installed.
  for_each   = data.flux_sync.main.patch_file_paths

  repository = github_repository.main.name
  file       = each.value
  content    = local.patches[each.key] # Get content of our patch files
  branch     = var.branch
}
```

The following `kustomize.yaml` will be generated by the`flux_sync` data source, where the names of the patch files
to include are generated from the `patch_names` argument. This is created in git by `github_repository_file.kustomize`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
- gotk-sync.yaml
- gotk-components.yaml
patchesStrategicMerge:
- patch-sops.yaml
```
